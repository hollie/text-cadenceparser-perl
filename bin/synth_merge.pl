=head1 NAME

synth_merge.pl - Merge and sort the area and power reports of Cadence synthesis runs

=head1 VERSION

version 1.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script merges area and power reports of tests of Cadence synthesis runs.
It enables sorting the design hierarchy according to their
percentage-wise contribution of the total area, active power, or leakage.

=head1 SYNOPSYS

Usage:
synth_merge.pl -a <area_file> -p <power_file> <mode> <threshold>

It is allowed to only pass either an area file or a power file. If
both files are passed, the results of both files are merged.

Also, it is not required to fill in C<mode> or C<threshold>.
If only an area file is passed, the C<mode> defaults to 'area'.
If only a power file is passed, C<mode> defaults to 'active'.
C<threshold> defaults to 1. This means that every unit that contributes
for more than one percent will be displayed. The other units will be
folded together and will be reported as a group at the end of the log.

Some more details on the parameters:

=over

=item area_rpt : Encounter RTL compiler file containing the area log

=item power_rpt: Encounter RTL compiler file containing the power log

=item mode: determines the sorting mode and can be

=over

=item area

=item active

=item leakage

=back

=item threshold: determined from what % of the selected mode the design hierarchy will be reported
