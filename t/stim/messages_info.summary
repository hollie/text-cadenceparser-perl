  4 Info DATABASE-105 The database was successfully written.             
                      The database is now saved to the file.             
  1 Info GLO-32       Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                      outputs.                                           
                      Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                      redundancy removal could change the connections    
                      so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                      anymore. To see the list of deleted instances,     
                      set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or      
                      above.                                             
  1 Info LBR-415      Library Information.                               
                      The number of unusable cells that is listed        
                      depends on the setting of the 'information_level'  
                      root attribute. If set to a value less than 6,     
                      the list is limited to 10 unusable cells. If set   
                      to a value equal to or higher than 6, all          
                      unusable cells are listed.                         
  2 Info MM_FE-53     File has been generated.                           
 18 Info PHYS-90      Generating design database.                        
                      The database contains all the files required to    
                      restore the design in the specified application.   
  1 Info POPT-51      Could not declone clock-gating instances.          
                      The design should have 2 or more clock-gating      
                      instances for decloning.                           
  4 Info ST-110       Connection established with super-threading        
                      server.                                            
                      RC is entering super-threading mode and has        
                      established a connection with a CPU server         
                      process.  This is enabled by the root attributes   
                      'super_thread_servers' or 'auto_super_thread'.     
  4 Info ST-112       A super-threading server has been shut down        
                      normally.                                          
                      A super-threaded optimization is complete and a    
                      CPU server was successfully shut down.             
  4 Info ST-120       Launching a super-threading server.                
                      RC is entering super-threading mode and is         
                      launching a CPU server process.  This is enabled   
                      by the root attribute 'super_thread_servers' or    
                      'auto_super_thread'.                               
  1 Info TIM-167      An external clock is being defined.                
                      An external clock does not directly drive any      
                      points within the design, but is only used as a    
                      reference for external delays.                     
  2 Info WDO-600      'Conformal LEC11.1-p100' or later builds is        
                      recommended for verification.                      
                      The use of 'Conformal LEC11.1-p100' or later       
                      builds is recommended to get better verification   
                      results.
