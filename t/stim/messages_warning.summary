340 Warning CHNM-110 Failed to change names.                            
  3 Warning PHYS-61  Expected data not found.                           
                     The inclusion of this data is not required,        
                     however it is highly recommended in order to       
                     achieve the best result. Rerun the command after   
                     supplying the data.                                
  1 Warning POPT-26  Inserting hierarchical clock-gating.               
                     The addition of new ports at the subdesign         
                     boundaries might cause issues during formal        
                     verification. If this is not acceptable, set the   
                     attribute 'lp_clock_gating_hierarchical' to        
                     'false' to turn off hierarchical clock-gating and  
                     restart synthesis.                                 
  1 Warning POPT-33  Failed to connect test signal to clock-gating      
                     logic.                                             
                     Define the test signal using the 'define_dft       
                     test_mode' or the 'define_dft shift_enable'        
                     command. Set the 'lp_clock_gating_test_signal'     
                     attribute on the design or clock-gating            
                     instance(s). Then rerun the 'clock_gating          
                     connect_test' command.                             
  4 Warning TIM-11   Possible timing problems have been detected in     
                     this design.                                       
                     Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.
